## üî• **Core Next.js Questions**

**1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between Next.js and CRA (Create React App)?**
Next.js is a **full-stack framework** that supports SSR, SSG, ISR, API routes, image optimization, and SEO out of the box. CRA is **just a frontend tool** for client-side rendering (CSR) with no built-in SEO or backend support.

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Explain the difference between SSR, SSG, and ISR in Next.js.**

   SSR ‚Üí Renders page on every request (always fresh, slower).
         Every time a user requests the page, Next.js will fetch data and render HTML on the server ‚Üí then send it to the client.
         Result: Always fresh data, but rendering happens on each request ‚Üí so it‚Äôs slower tha
          
            export async function getServerSideProps() {
                   const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/products");
                   const data = await res.json();
                   return { props: { data } };
                }

   SSG ‚Üí Renders page once at build time (fast but static).
          Next.js generates the HTML at build time (when you deploy). The same static HTML is served to all users.
          Result: Super fast, but data is fixed until next build.
          ‚úÖ Use case: Data that rarely changes (e.g., blog posts, documentation, marketing pages).

          export async function getStaticProps() {
                    const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/blogs");
                    const data = await res.json();
                    return { props: { data } };
            }

   ISR ‚Üí Combines both; static pages are rebuilt automatically after a set time.
          export async function getStaticProps() {
                const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/news");
                const data = await res.json();
                return {
                    props: { data },
                    revalidate: 60, // page will refresh every 60 sec in background
                };
            }

---

**3Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and `getStaticPaths`?**

     getStaticPaths ka matlab kya hai?
    ‚úÖ Jab tum Next.js me dynamic routes banate ho (jaise [id].js file), to Next.js ko ye pata hona chahiye ki kin kin dynamic pages
        ko pehle se build karna hai (SSG ‚Äì Static Site Generation ke time).

    üëâ getStaticPaths isi ka kaam karta hai ‚Äì ye Next.js ko list of paths (jaise IDs ya slugs) deta hai jo build time pe banaye jaayenge.

    1Ô∏è‚É£ getStaticProps
                Kaam: Yeh function static data ko build time pe fetch karta hai.

                Yeh static pages generate karta hai using data fetched during build.

                Fast hota hai, SEO friendly hota hai.

                Har dynamic page ke liye yeh data ko fetch karta hai, lekin usse pehle path chahiye hota hai... jo getStaticPaths deta hai.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ getServerSideProps ‚Äì (SSR ke liye)
    üëâ Har ek request par data fetch hota hai ‚Äì yani jab bhi user page load karega, server API se naya data leke HTML banata hai.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ What are Server Components and Client Components in Next.js 13+?**
By default, components in Next.js are **Server Components** (no JS sent to browser, super fast). If you add `use client` at the top, it becomes a **Client Component** (can use state, events, hooks like `useState`).

---

**5Ô∏è‚É£ How does Next.js handle routing differently than React Router?**
Next.js uses **file-based routing** ‚Äî every file in `pages/` or `app/` becomes a route. React Router needs you to **manually write `<Route>`** in code.

---

**6Ô∏è‚É£ What are API Routes in Next.js and how do they differ from Express APIs?**
API routes are created by adding files inside `pages/api/`. They work like serverless functions ‚Äî no need to set up Express, and they scale automatically.

---

**7Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between using `fetch` in `getServerSideProps` vs inside a React component?**

* In **getServerSideProps**: Data is fetched on the **server**, page loads with data already present (good for SEO).
* In React component: Fetch happens on the **client**, so the page first loads empty.

---

**8Ô∏è‚É£ How does Next.js handle code splitting and bundling?**
Each page in Next.js gets its **own JavaScript bundle** ‚Äî only the code for that page is loaded. In CRA, **one large JS bundle** loads everything (slower).

---    

**9Ô∏è‚É£ Explain `next/image` and how it optimizes images.**
`next/image` automatically **resizes, lazy-loads, and serves modern formats** like WebP for better performance. `<img>` doesn‚Äôt do any optimization.

---

**üîü What is Middleware in Next.js?**
Middleware runs **before** a request hits your page. It can **redirect, rewrite, or block** requests ‚Äî useful for things like authentication or logging.

---

## ‚ö° **React + Next.js Integration**

**1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Since React now supports SSR, why do we still need Next.js?**
React only provides SSR capability; Next.js adds **routing, file-based APIs, image optimization, ISR, middleware** ‚Äî all production-ready features.

---

**1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ How does hydration work in Next.js with React?**
The server sends **HTML first** (SSR/SSG), then React attaches JS (hydration) to make the page interactive. If server HTML and client render differ, **hydration errors** appear.

---

**1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between Client Components in Next.js and traditional React components?**
Traditional React components are **all client-side**. In Next.js, components are **server by default** ‚Äî you must mark them as **Client Components** with `use client` if you want hooks/events.

---

**1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Can you use React Context API or Redux with Next.js Server Components?**
Yes, but Server Components can‚Äôt hold state. You wrap your app with **Client Components** (like `<Provider>`) for Redux or Context to work.

---

**1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle SEO in a React app vs a Next.js app?**
React CSR apps send almost empty HTML to search engines, so SEO is poor. Next.js uses SSR/SSG to send **full HTML content**, making it SEO-friendly.

---

**1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ How do you handle authentication in Next.js?**
Use **NextAuth**, JWT with cookies, or middleware to check auth. SSR pages can check cookies in `getServerSideProps` to secure pages.

---

**1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ How does Next.js improve performance with React compared to CRA?**
Next.js uses **code splitting, prefetching, caching, SSR/SSG** ‚Äî so pages load faster, SEO works, and the app feels snappy.

---

## üöÄ **Advanced / Tricky**

**1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ How does ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) work internally?**
Pages are built at build time like SSG. When someone visits after `revalidate` time, Next.js **rebuilds the page in the background** while serving the old page.

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ How would you debug a hydration error in a Next.js app?**
    Hydration error tab hota hai jab server aur client ka HTML output match nahi karta.
    Matlab:

    Server ne jo HTML bheja (initial render) aur

    Browser ne React se jo HTML render kiya (client-side render)

    Dono alag-alag ho gaye ‚Üí isse browser confuse ho jata hai aur hydration error aata hai.

    ‚úÖ Debug kaise kare?

    Dekho kya server render aur client render ka output same hai ya nahi.

    Common mistakes:

    Random IDs generate karna server aur client me (har render me alag ID ban rahi).

    window, document ya localStorage jaisi browser-only cheeze directly use karna (kyunki server ke paas ye nahi hote).

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ How would you secure sensitive API keys in a Next.js project?**
Keep them in `.env.local` (only server sees them). Never put API keys in **Client Components** because that exposes them.

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ How does the Next.js App Router change the way we fetch data compared to Pages Router?**
App Router lets you fetch **inside async Server Components** (simpler). Pages Router needs `getStaticProps`/`getServerSideProps`.

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ When should you choose CSR (Client-Side Rendering) in Next.js instead of SSR/SSG?**
    Use CSR when data is **private to the user** (like dashboards)
    Data sirf user ke liye private ho 
    SEO important nahi hai 
    Data page load ke baad hi fetch karna ho 

---

**2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ How does Next.js integrate with TypeScript? What‚Äôs different from CRA setup?**
In Next.js, just add a `.ts` or `.tsx` file ‚Äî Next.js auto-creates `tsconfig.json`. In CRA, you set it up manually.
