1) How do you make JWT secure?

👉 Answer: Use HTTPS: Always send JWT over HTTPS so attackers can’t sniff the token.

            Strong Secret Key: Use a strong, unpredictable secret key for signing.

            Short Expiry Time: Keep access tokens short-lived (e.g., 15–30 min) to reduce risk if leaked.

            Use Refresh Tokens: Issue a refresh token for getting new access tokens without forcin er to log in again.

            Safe Storage: Store JWT in HTTP-only cookies instead of localStorage to protect from XSS attack.

===================================================================================================================================================      
2)Is it safe to store JWT in localStorage?
👉 Answer: ❌ Not safe. LocalStorage is accessible to JavaScript, so if an XSS attack happens, the attacker can steal it.

            ✅ Better option: Store JWT in HTTP-only secure cookies (they can’t be accessed via JavaScript).

===================================================================================================================================================      
3)What information should NOT be stored in JWT?
👉 Answer:  Never store sensitive data (passwords, bank info, Aadhaar number, etc.) in JWT because it’s Base64 encoded, not encrypted — anyone decode it.

            Only store non-sensitive info like user ID, email, or role (admin/user)

===================================================================================================================================================      

4)How do you refresh JWT when it expires?
👉 Answer:  Use short-lived access tokens (e.g., 15 mins).

            Use longer-lived refresh tokens (e.g., 7 days).

            When the access token expires, the frontend sends the refresh token to the server, which verifies it and issues a new access token.

===================================================================================================================================================      
 5)What security measures would you add with JWT?
👉 Answer:Send JWT only over HTTPS so no one can “see” or steal it while it’s traveling over the internet.
          Use Refresh Tokens –👉 Give short‑lived JWTs + a refresh token to get new ones safely.Store JWT safely –
        👉 If you store in browser → use HttpOnly cookies (JavaScript can’t read them) to protect from XSS attacks.
          Don’t put too much info inside JWT. Only include what’s necessary (like user ID).

===================================================================================================================================================      
6)What do you do if a JWT is compromised?
👉 Answer:  Immediately rotate the secret key (issue a new key).

            Invalidate all existing tokens (blacklist/expire).

              Force all users to log in again.

Explain the parts of a JWT (header, payload, signature).
👉 Answer:

Header: Contains the token type (JWT) and algorithm (e.g., HS256).

Payload: Stores user info (userID, role, expiry time).

Signature: Hashed with a secret key to ensure the token hasn’t been tampered with.

In short (most common RESTful API design):
GET → JSON (200 OK)  Object | Array<Object>

POST → JSON (201 Created)  Object / JSON

PUT → JSON (200 OK or 204 No Content)  Object | null

PATCH → JSON (200 OK)

DELETE → 204 No Content or success message JSON  Object | null


setTimeout → Executes a function once after a specified delay (in milliseconds).

setInterval → Executes a function repeatedly at a specified time interval
