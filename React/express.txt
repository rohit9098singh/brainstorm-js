1) what is express ?

 Express ek lightweight aur flexible Node.js framework hai jo HTTP requests handle karne ke liye use hota hai.
 Ye frontend aur backend ke beech communication simplify karta hai, routing provide karta hai,
 aur APIs ya web applications banana easy banata hai

===================================================================================================================================================      

 2️⃣ What is middleware in Express?
 Middleware is a function that runs between the request and response.

 Types of middleware?
 Application-level middleware – app.use() for logging, authentication.

  Router-level middleware – middleware specific to routes.

  Built-in middleware – e.g. express.json(), express.static().

  Error-handling middleware – (err, req, res, next) signature

===================================================================================================================================================      

4️⃣ What is the difference between app.use() and app.get()/app.post()?
1) app.use() → for middleware
2) app.get() / app.post() → for specific HTTP method routes.
===================================================================================================================================================      

6️⃣  How do you secure an Express app?
Use Helmet.js → sets security headers.
✅ Use CORS properly → restrict allowed origins.
✅ Use rate limiting → prevent brute-force attacks.
✅ Always run on HTTPS.

5) CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete — the four basic operations for managing data in most applications.

Create – Add new data to the database (e.g., user signup).

Read – Fetch or view data (e.g., view user profile).

Update – Modify existing data (e.g., edit profile info).

Delete – Remove data (e.g., delete account).

✅ Bonus point: “CRUD is the foundation of REST APIs and is used in almost every web or mobile app.”

In an Express + MongoDB API, I would create routes like:

POST /users → to create a user

GET /users → to fetch all users

PUT /users/:id → to update user info

DELETE /users/:id → to delete a user
