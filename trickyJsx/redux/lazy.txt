1. Lazy Loading of Images
Definition
Lazy loading is a technique where images (or other resources) are loaded only when they are about to enter the viewport, instead of loading all at once on page load.
Improves performance and reduces initial load time.

2. Lazy Loading of Components (React)
Definition

In React, lazy loading components means loading a component only when it’s needed (e.g., on a specific route or on user interaction).
import React, { Suspense } from "react";

const About = React.lazy(() => import("./About"));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <About />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
