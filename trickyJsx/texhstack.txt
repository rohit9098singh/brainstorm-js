For Book Kart, I built a full-stack web application using the MERN stack with Next.js for a modern and responsive user experience.

On the frontend, I used Next.js for routing and SSR, Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for efficient state and API management, and Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive UI.

On the backend, I developed secure REST APIs with Node.js and Express.js, and used MongoDB as the database for managing users, books, and orders.

For authentication, I implemented JWT with email verification, along with secure APIs for features like cart, wishlist, and product management.

So overall, my stack is Next.js, Redux Toolkit (RTK Query), Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT.‚Äù
